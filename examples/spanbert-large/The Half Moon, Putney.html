From the psychedelia of The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band and <span style="border:2px solid rgb(98,35,23);">Bob Kerr's </span>Whoopee Band; to 1960s mod groups The Pretty Things and Nashville Teens; to early pub-rock acts such as Dr. Feelgood; <span style="border:2px solid rgb(57,12,140);">the Half Moon </span>was the centre of not only the emerging music scenes but continued to host the big names.<span style="border:2px solid rgb(57,12,140);">It </span>was never just a "passing through" venue.
